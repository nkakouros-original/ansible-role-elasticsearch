elastic_enabled: true
# Set to false to completely disable the role

# Installation{{{
elastic_major_version: 7
# The major version of elasticsearch to install. This will also be used to add
# the relevant repository.

elastic_minor_version: 7
# The minor version of elasticsearch to install. Set to `*` to install the
# latest minor version for the `elastic_major_version`.

elastic_disable_auto_update: false
# Whether to exclude elasticsearch from automatic system updates. Set this to
# true if you want to manually update elasticsearch. This is valid only for
# Linux servers that may have some kind of unattended update mechanism.

elastic_user: root
# The user that will own elasticsearch files. Elasticsearch will be run as the
# `elasticsearch` user as defined in the systemd service file that comes with
# the elasticsearch installation, regardless of this setting. If you want to
# change that user as well, you can use the `elastic_systemd_override` variable
# to change the user that systemd will use to run elasticsearch.

elastic_group: elasticsearch
# The group that `elasticsearch_user` will be added to. If the `kibana_user` is
# `root`, the `root` user will not be added to this group. By default, when
# installing elasticsearch, the configuration files are owned by user `root` and
# group `elasticsearch`. The default behavior of the role is to replicate this,
# while giving the option to the user to run elasticsearch as an arbitrary
# user/group if they need to.

# Security{{{
elastic_builtin_users_password_backup_file: ~
# The role will set random passwords for the built-in users, using the
# `elasticsearch-setup-passwords` utility that comes with Elasticsearch.  These
# users and passwords can be used to interact with elasticsearch. This will
# happen only the first time you install and configure elasticsearch. You can
# use these passwords to login into elasticsearch.  Set this variable to a path
# on the ansible controller where these random passwords for the builtin users
# will be saved in. The records will be in a `{"name": user, password: pass}`
# format and can be loaded into an ansible variable with the `file` lookup
# plugin. If you leave this variable None, the new passwords will be only
# printed during provisioning and you will have no way of finding them
# afterwards. In this case, provide a custom password for the `elastic` user in
# `elastic_users` which the role will use to update the `elastic` user before
# exiting. Otherwise, the role will fail in later runs as there will be no user
# to connect to elasticsearch.

# TODO currently not supported, do not use, no password is set on the keystore.
# Need to:
# - supply the password when setting passwrods for builtin users
# - supply the password for http and transport ssl
# - what else is stored in the keystore??
elastic_keystore_password: ~
# The password to encrypt the elastic keystore.

# Roles {{{
elastic_custom_roles: []
# Use this variable to define a list of custom roles for users. The syntax of
# each role is simply the YAML equivalent of the json syntax for defining a role
# (see the docs). Example:

# Realms {{{
# Native realm {{{
elastic_users: []
# Example:
# elastic_users:
#   - name: my_user  # required

#     enabled: true  # defaults to true
#     email: user@email.com
#     full_name: User Name
#     roles:         # you can also use `groups` instead of `roles`
#       - beats_admin
#
# Use this variable to create custom users on Elasticsearch. Depending on your
# workflow, you may also want to use this to add custom passwords for the
# built-in users, which will overwrite the random ones created by the role.

# Certificates {{{
# You can use the variables in this section to generate certificates and
# upload them to elasticsearch nodes. These can then be used in
# `elastic_config` to setup TLS for the transport or http layer of
# elasticsearch.

elastic_certificates_password: ~
# The password to use to protect the generated private keys. Leave empty to set
# the empty string as the password. Certificates do need to have a password even
# if it is blank.

elastic_certificates_password_renew: false
# When uploading a certificate to a node, its password will be stored to the
# elasticsearch keystore on that node. If you change the
# `elastic_certificates_password` eg when renewing certificates, then the old
# password stored on a node's keystore will cause failures. Thus, if you are
# updating the certificate password, set this variable to true to update the
# node's keystore as well. The default here is false to support idempotency.

elastic_certificates: ~
# Use this variable to point to a certificate file on the ansible controller
# that should be uploaded to the elasticsearch node and be used as the
# certificate for that node. Eg:
# elastic_certificates:
#   ca: path/to/ca.cert
#   cert: path/to/node/cert
#   key: path/to/node/key

elastic_certificates_dir: /etc/elasticsearch/certs/
# The folder where `elastic_certificates` will be uploaded into.

elastic_ssl_http: false
elastic_ssl_transport: false
# Set to true to have the role populate the elasticsearch settings that will
# enable TLS encryption for the HTTP endpoint and the transport layer
# respectively. If you keep these variable to false, you will have to manually
# configure elasticsearch (via the `elastic_config` variable) to use the
# certificates.

elastic_ssl_verification_mode: full
# Whether to request connecting clients to provide a valid certificate. This
# will be used if `elastic_ssl_http/elastic_ssl_transport` are set to true.

# Configuration {{{
elastic_jvm_min_heap_size: 1g
elastic_jvm_max_heap_size: 1g
# Set the minimum and maximum JVM heap size in jvm.options

elastic_jvm_extra_config: ~
# Use this to append extra configuration directives in the jvm.options file.

elastic_config: {}
# Elastic configuration in the form of a yaml array with non-collapsed keys.
# This will be merged with a default configuration shipped with this role. The

# set them again. You could include that info directly in `elastic_config` and
# ignore these variables below. The `elastic_config` array will be output as is
# into the `/etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml` file. The default
# configuration can be found in the `vars/main.yml` file of this role. For what
# these settings do, consult the elastic search documentation.

elastic_bind_host: localhost
# The address where elastic will listen on for requests to its JSON api.

elastic_transport_port: 9300
# The port that elastic search will use to communicate with other nodes.

elastic_cluster_name: elasticsearch
# The name of the cluster the node will belong to.

elastic_cluster_initial_master_nodes:
  - "{{ elastic_node_name }}"
# The list of initial master-eligible nodes that will be used to bootstrap the

# Plugins {{{
elastic_plugins: []
# A list of elasticsearch plugins to install. This can be a list of plugin

# formats.
# ```
# elastic_plugins:
#   - repository-aws
#   - name: repository-gcs
#     mandatory: true
# ```
# The `mandatory` keyword will instruct the role to add this plugin in the
# comma-separated list under `plugin.mandatory` in the `elastic_config`. This
# means that elasticsearch will fail to start if the plugin is not installed.

# Repository GCS {{{
# For this plugin, you need to create a Google Cloud Storage and Google Cloud
# credentials outside of this role.

elastic_plugin_gcs_enabled: false
# Set to true to have the role configure the repository-gcs plugin.

elastic_plugin_gcs_credentials: ~
# The GCP credentials to use for the repository-gcs plugin. This must be set if

# }}}
# Others {{{
elastic_index_templates: []
# This is a list of files that contain index templates that should be imported
# into elasticsearch. This is useful in cases you need to load an
# auditbeat/packetbeat/etc index template manually because the beat installation
# does not have direct access to elasticsearch and the `setup` command cannot be
# used. The format should be similar to this:
# ```
# elastic_index_templates:
#   - name: the-name-of-the-index-template
#     file: /path/to/json/template/file
#     overrides:
#       mappings:
#         properties:
#           url:
#             full:
#               type: keyword
#               ignore_above: 8192
#               fields:
#                 text:
#                   type: text
#                   norms: false
# ```
# In this example a template is loaded from a file and some overrides are
# applied. The overrides are useful in instances where you get a template from
# a source but need to modify it a bit. For instance, the `url.full` field in
# the packetbeat template is configured with `ignore_above: 1024` which may be
# too limiting. The example above will reconfigure the `url.full` field with
# `ignore_above: 8192`.
# You can omit the `overrides` key. You can also omit the `file` key and supply
# the `overrides` key. In this case, an existing template in elasticsearch will
# be read and then updated using the overrides.

elastic_ingest_pipelines: []
